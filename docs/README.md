# dp/docs

`dp` consists of a backend and a frontend.

The backend exposes an API for registering, deleting, and modifying dataproducts.
Additionally, the API contains functionality to grant and remove access on individual dataproducts.
Consult the [API spec](./api-spec.md) for more information.

The frontend serves as a way for users to browse dataproducts, and gain access to the dataproducts they wish to read.
